# LeafLang-compiler
This is a programming language which is created by myself.  
Note that this language is still under development.  
## How to Use  
Currently only Syntax Parser is available.  
Run Syntax Parser:  
```shell
cd LeafLang-compiler
python3 Node.py
```
And then, Typing LeafLang Code and `enter` ,you will get the parsed NodeData
