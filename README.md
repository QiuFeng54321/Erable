Hi!Welcome to erable!

## What is it?
A programming language created by Qiufeng54321.  
It is still under development.  

## How to use?
Remember this project is still under development.However, you can still check out the parser feature.  
It parses the file and gives the java-object-lized output as diagnostics and debuggings.  
```shell
cd Erable
chmod +x ./erable.sh # just to ensure you have the permission.
./erable.sh -f test.erable #replace test.erable or don't to see the result.
```
